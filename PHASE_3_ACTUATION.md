# 🌫️ FogSift Phase 3: The Actuation Bridge

## 🎯 Objective
To move from **Observation** (logging moisture) to **Actuation** (moving water).

## 🏗️ The Infrastructure
1. **Physical Mesh:** Deployment of the ESP32 Soil Node to the Chico field.
2. **Logic Gate:** A local script that triggers a relay if moisture < 40%.
3. **The Labyrinth Loop:** Syncing physical relay events back to the Minotaur Game logs.

# 🏺 How to Contribute to Awesome Folk Code

We use a "Terminal-First" workflow. If you want to help curate the list, follow these steps:

## 1. Scouting Missions
Check the [Mission Board](https://github.com/orgs/FogSift/projects/2) for open tasks. These are projects we've identified but haven't written "Vibe Descriptions" for yet.

## 2. Using the Curation Tool
If you are running a local node, you can automate your PRs using the provided script:
\`\`\`bash
./scripts/intelligence/curate_mission.sh
\`\`\`

## 3. Submitting New Projects
If you have a project of your own, use the [New Submission Form](https://github.com/FogSift/awesome-folk-code/issues/new/choose).

Maintain watch. 🌫️

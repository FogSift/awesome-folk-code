# Contributing to Awesome Folk Code

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This list is all about celebrating the cool, everyday tools built by regular people using AI and vibe coding.

To keep this list high-quality and true to its mission, please follow these guidelines when submitting a new project:

## The Rules for Inclusion
1. **Built by "Folk":** The project should primarily be built by a non-traditional developer (hobbyist, dad, mom, truck driver, etc.) using AI tools (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).
2. **It Actually Works:** The project must be functional and accessible (either open-source on GitHub, or a live free tool). No waitlists or broken links.
3. **Solves a Real Problem:** We love niche! Whether it tracks sourdough hydration or automates fantasy football, it should have a clear use case.
4. **No Enterprise/Corporate Shills:** This is for indie, grassroots, vibe-coded projects. No VC-funded startups thinly veiled as indie projects.

## How to Format Your Entry
Please format your addition exactly like this:
`- [Project Name](Link) - A clear, one-sentence description of what it does and who built it. No buzzwords.`

**Example:**
- [Toddler Chore Wheel](https://example.com) - A randomized daily task generator for kids built by a stay-at-home dad using Claude.

## How to Submit
**If you know GitHub:**
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your link to the appropriate category in the `README.md` (keep it in alphabetical order!).
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a brief note about the project.

**If you are new to GitHub:**
Don't worry about Pull Requests! Just click on the **Issues** tab at the top of this page, click "New Issue", and drop the link and description there. We will format it and add it for you.

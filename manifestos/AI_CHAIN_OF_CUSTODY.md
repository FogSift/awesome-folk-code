# 🛡️ AI Chain of Custody & Git Safety

When working with AI-generated code, you are the **Human-in-the-Loop**. You are responsible for the logic you deploy.

## 🧭 Principles
1. **Never Blind-Push:** Always run code locally before committing to the mesh.
2. **Logic Sifting:** If you don't understand what a line of code does, ask the AI to explain it before you accept it.
3. **The Reset Protocol:** Use Git to revert if an AI "hallucination" breaks your system logic.

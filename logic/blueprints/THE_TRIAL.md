# ⚔️ The Vibe Coder's Trial

Before you can add your awesome project to the main list, you must pass **The Trial**. 

**Why?** Because we need to know that you (and your AI) understand how to use the "Garage" safely. We need to see that you can create a Branch, make a Commit, and open a Pull Request without accidentally deleting the main project.

## Your Mission
Add your name to the **Ledger of Initiates** at the bottom of this document.

### The Steps:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Create your safe parallel universe: `git checkout -b trial-yourname`
3. Edit this file (`THE_TRIAL.md`) and add your info to the bottom of the table.
4. Stage your changes: `git add THE_TRIAL.md`
5. Lock it in: `git commit -m "I have passed the trial"`
6. Push it to the cloud: `git push -u origin trial-yourname`
7. Open a Pull Request!

Once the maintainer reviews your PR and merges it, you are officially a Vibe Coder. You are now cleared to submit your actual projects to the main directory.

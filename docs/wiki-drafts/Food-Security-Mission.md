# 🌽 Food Security Mission: Decentralized Actuation

FogSift's ultimate downstream objective is **Decentralized Food Security**. We believe that by combining local AI logic with offline hardware, we can make fresh, healthy food accessible to everyone.

## 🏗️ The Systems Architecture
Every FogSift food security artifact follows this conceptual stack:

[ Local Sensors ] (Moisture / PH / Temp)
        ↓
[ Edge Model / LLM ] (Local inference on Mac/Pi)
        ↓
[ Decision Engine ] (Logic for optimization)
        ↓
[ Actuator ] (Irrigation / Seeder / Weeder)
        ↓
[ Local Yield ] (Household Resilience)

---

## 🧭 Constraints & Non-Goals
To maintain focus, we define what FogSift is **not**:
* ❌ **No Industrial Monoculture:** We are not building systems for big-ag optimization.
* ❌ **No Cloud Dependence:** Logic must fail-over to local actuation if the upstream bridge resets.
* ❌ **No Human Replacement:** We are augmenting households and hobbyists, not replacing the farmer.

## 🧪 Phase Gates
We measure progress through four distinct signal layers:
1. **Phase 0 — Simulation:** Logic tested in the Labyrinth or local digital twins.
2. **Phase 1 — Backyard Pilot:** Single-node physical actuation (e.g., Soil-Sync-Beta).
3. **Phase 2 — Distributed Trials:** Multiple garage labs testing the same artifact.
4. **Phase 3 — Local Mesh:** Cooperative data sharing between local nodes.

*Status: Transitioning from Phase 0 to Phase 1.*

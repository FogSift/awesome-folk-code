# 🔭 Tactical Intel: System Orientation

This intel report explains the real-world engineering concepts simulated in the **Labyrinth of Logic**.

---

## 🛰️ 01. The Global Mesh (GPS & Pinging)
In the simulator, we ping the mesh at **39.7285° N, 121.8375° W**. 
These are the terrestrial coordinates for **Chico, California**. 
**The Concept:** Before hardware can actuate (move), it must establish its location relative to the global satellite mesh.

## 🔑 02. SSH (Secure Shell)
The Minotaur room is protected by an SSH gate.
**The Concept:** SSH is how we talk to computers remotely (like your Cloudflare-hosted server) without letting the whole world listen in. If you don't have the key, you don't get in.

## 🔍 03. Grep (Pattern Finding)
Grep is the ultimate "filter" tool. 
**The Concept:** When a supply chain breaks, you are buried in thousands of lines of logs. Grep allows you to ignore the noise and find the one line (the "signal") that explains the failure.

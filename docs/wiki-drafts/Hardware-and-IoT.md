# 🛡️ Hardware & IoT: Tactical Gear

This page acts as the "Garage Manual" for the physical components used in FogSift artifacts.

## 📡 The Local Actuation Loop
Hardware must be autonomous. If the upstream bridge (Mac/Cloudflare) fails, the hardware should maintain its last "Safe State."

## 🛠️ Vetted Hardware List
See the [Gear Directory](https://github.com/FogSift/awesome-folk-code/tree/main/gear) for specific parts and shopping lists.

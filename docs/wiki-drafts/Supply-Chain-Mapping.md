# 🗺️ Supply Chain Mapping: The FogSift Method

To "sift the fog," we must map the dependencies of our systems. 

## 01. Upstream Visibility
* **Data Sources:** Where is the logic coming from? (e.g., Local LLM, Satellite Mesh).
* **Energy:** How is the node powered? (e.g., Grid, Solar, Battery).

## 02. Downstream Actuation
* **The Result:** What physical change occurred? (e.g., Pump engaged, Seeder moved).
* **The Value:** Who benefited from the output? (e.g., Household, Local Cooperative).

## 03. Identifying Reset Risks
A "Reset" is any event that disconnects the bridge. We map these to create **Fail-over Logic**.

# ⚔️ Git Survival Guide for Vibe Coders

You don't need to be a senior engineer to manage your garage tools. You just need three spells.

## 🪄 The Essential Spells
1. \`git add .\` - Gather your new artifacts.
2. \`git commit -m "sync: description"\` - Stamp the logic into history.
3. \`git push\` - Transmit your changes to the cloud.

*If you get lost, run \`vibe-check.sh\` in your terminal.*

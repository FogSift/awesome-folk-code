# 🌫️ Phase 2: The Operational Harvest

## 🎯 The Mission
To bridge the gap between AI-driven logic and physical soil. This repository is the central nervous system for the FogSift food security pilots.

## 🏗️ Core Pillars
1. **Sovereign Actuation:** We don't just log data; we move water.
2. **Transparent Supply Chains:** We map every seed, sensor, and circuit.
3. **Vibe-Coded Resilience:** Our systems must work even if the upstream "Cloud" resets.

## 🏺 The First Artifacts
* **Soil-Sync-Beta:** Real-time moisture telemetry via ESP32.
* **The Labyrinth:** An interactive onboarding gate for new initiates.
* **Weekly Intelligence:** Automated strategy reports for the mesh.

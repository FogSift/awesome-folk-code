# GitHub for Regular Folk: A Translation Guide

GitHub was built by software engineers, for software engineers. It uses words that sound complicated but actually represent very simple concepts. 

Think of GitHub as **Google Drive for code, but with version history on steroids.**

Here is the secret decoder ring for the four main words you will see:

* **Repository (Repo):** This is just a **Folder**. `awesome-folk-code` is just a public folder sitting on a computer somewhere containing a text document (the README) and a few rules.
* **Fork:** This means **"Make a personal copy."** You aren't allowed to directly edit someone else's public folder. When you click "Fork," GitHub makes a perfect photocopy of their folder and puts it in your account so you can mess with it.
* **Commit:** This is just a fancy word for **Save**. When you make a change to a file and "Commit" it, you are permanently saving that version of the file. 
* **Pull Request (PR):** This means **"Suggest an edit."** After you make a change in your personal copy (your Fork), you send a Pull Request to the owner of the original folder. You are basically politely asking: *"Hey, I added my project to my copy of the list. Do you want to pull my change into the official folder?"*

## How to Submit Your Project (Without Touching a Terminal)

If you built a cool vibe-coded project and want to add it to the `awesome-folk-code` list, you don't need to download any hacker software. You can do the whole thing right in your web browser in about 60 seconds.

### The "I'm Scared of GitHub" Method (Easiest)
If you don't want to deal with editing files at all:
1. Go to the `awesome-folk-code` repository page.
2. Click the **Issues** tab near the top.
3. Click the green **New Issue** button.
4. Type the name of your project, paste the link, and write a one-sentence description of what it does.
5. Click **Submit**. The maintainer will format it and add it to the list for you.

### The "I Want to Feel Like a Hacker" Method (The PR)
If you want to officially submit your code to the list yourself:
1. Go to the `awesome-folk-code` repository and click the **README.md** file.
2. Look for the little **Pencil Icon** (Edit this file) in the top right corner of the document box and click it. 
    * *(Behind the scenes, GitHub is automatically making a "Fork" for you).*
3. Scroll down the text document and type your link into the correct category. Follow the formatting of the other links!
4. Click the green **Commit changes...** button at the top right.
5. A box will pop up asking for a description. Just write something simple like: *"Added my sourdough tracker to the Hobbies section."*
6. Click **Propose changes**, and then click **Create pull request**. 

Boom. You just contributed to open-source software.
